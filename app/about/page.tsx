      <p>
        I&apos;m a front-end developer with a background in education and a deep
        love for clean, accessible UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last 6 months I&apos;ve focused on modern JavaScript, React,
        and building real projects that solve problems.
      </p>

        I enjoy learning, mentoring, and creating experiences that feel simple
        and intuitive for users.
